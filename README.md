# Tricycle

## What is this?

This project is a web app for coding exercises. It's entirely
client-side, and can be run on any web server.

## Where can I try it?

[http://davidwyde.com/code/tricycle/](http://davidwyde.com/code/tricycle/)

## Why did you do this?

I'm interested in helping people learn to code.

I also wanted to get some more practice with JavaScript.

## Do you know about Project Euler?

[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) is a very good resource for
learning to code; however, it's also very math-heavy. String processing,
list operations, and objects/dictionaries are also important.

## How did you make this?

[AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) makes single-page web apps easy.

State is stored using [local storage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_storage).
